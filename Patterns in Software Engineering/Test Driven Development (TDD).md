- They can be seen as requirements and documentation, If your tests are well written.

## Benefits:
- Significant reductions in defect rates, at the cost of a moderate increase in initial development effort.
- Reduce the effort in the final phases of a project (for testing and documentation).
- Practitioners report that TDD leads to improved design qualities in the code (mainly on the object design level).
- Higher degree of “internal” or technical quality, for instance improving the metrics of cohesion and coupling.

## Limitations:
- It can be very tedious in the beginning:
	- You need to write tests for everything.
	- You need a lot of (small) tests.
- It can be frustrating, even (especially?) for experienced developers.
	- You need to stick to the TDD cycle and write tests before you write code.
	- You need to learn how to write good tests, that drive your design.
