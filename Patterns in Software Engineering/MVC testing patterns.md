## There is two testing patterns for the MVC:
### View state test pattern:
`The View State Testing Pattern ensures the quality of the user experience.`

The View State Testing Pattern involves testing the state of the view component of the MVC architecture. This typically involves testing the presentation layer, including the user interface and the way that data is displayed to the user. The goal of this pattern is to ensure that the view component behaves as expected and that the user experience is consistent with the design.

### Model state test pattern:
`The Model State Testing Pattern ensures the quality of the data processing and storage.`

`This pattern simulates user input by invoking a state change event such as "KeyUp", "Click”, entering a test string “Max Musterman”, etc.`

The Model State Testing Pattern involves testing the state of the model component of the MVC architecture. This typically involves testing the business logic and the way that data is processed and stored. The goal of this pattern is to ensure that the model component behaves as expected and that data is processed and stored correctly.
