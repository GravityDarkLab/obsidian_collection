They are [[Design patterns]].

Structural design patterns are design patterns that deal with object ==composition== and the ==relationship== between objects. They provide ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality. Some common structural patterns include:
- **[[Adapter pattern]]**: adapts one interface to another so that classes can work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
- **[[Bridge pattern]]**: separates an object's interface from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
- **[[Composite pattern]]**: composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- **[[Decorator pattern]]**: adds new behavior to an individual object without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
- **[[Facade pattern]]**: provides a single interface to a complex subsystem.
- **[[Flyweight pattern]]**: reduces the number of objects created by a program and uses sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.
- **[[Proxy pattern]]**: controls access to an object by providing a surrogate.
