It is an [[Anti-pattern]].

The Vendor lock-in antipattern refers to a situation where a software system or architecture is designed in such a way that it is tightly tied to a specific vendor or technology, making it difficult or expensive to switch to another vendor or technology. This creates a dependence on the vendor, and reduces the ability to make changes or take advantage of new advancements in technology.

To refactor this pattern, a developer should aim to design the system in a way that reduces the dependence on a specific vendor or technology. This can be achieved by using open standards, APIs, and protocols, and by implementing abstractions that allow the system to be easily adapted to different vendors or technologies.
