It is a [[Design patterns]].

Behavioral patterns are design patterns that deal with communication between objects, and how to distribute responsibilities among objects. They are used to solve problems related to the interaction between objects, such as how objects should communicate with each other, how they should be composed and how they should share their responsibilities.

Here is a list of some common behavioral patterns:
1.  **Chain of Responsibility**: a pattern that allows a request to be passed through a chain of objects, where each object can decide whether to process the request or pass it on to the next object in the chain.
2.  **[[Command pattern]]**: a pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, which can be passed around and executed later.
3.  **Interpreter**: a pattern that defines a language and provides an interpreter for that language.
4.  **Iterator**: a pattern that allows elements of a collection to be accessed one at a time without exposing the underlying representation.
5.  **[[Mediator pattern]]**: a pattern that allows objects to communicate with each other without knowing each other's identities. --> communicate throw a Mediator.
6.  **Memento**: a pattern that allows an object's internal state to be saved and restored later.
7.  **[[Observer pattern]]**: a pattern that allows objects to be notified when the state of another object changes.
8.  **[[State pattern]]**: a pattern that allows an object's behavior to change depending on its internal state.
9.  **[[Strategy pattern]]**: a pattern that allows an algorithm or a group of related algorithms to be selected at runtime, depending on the specific requirements of the client.
10.  **[[Template method pattern]]**: a pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm, with some steps being implemented by subclasses.
11.  **Visitor**: a pattern that allows an operation to be applied to the elements of a collection, without changing the classes of the elements themselves.
