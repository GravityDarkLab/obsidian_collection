They are [[Design patterns]].

Creational patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, ==trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation==. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

There are several creational design patterns, such as:

-   **[[Abstract Factory pattern]]**: provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
-   **[[Builder pattern]]**: separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.
-   **[[Factory Method pattern]]**: defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
-   **Prototype pattern**: creates new objects by copying existing objects (prototypes)
-   **Singleton pattern**: ensures a class only has one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

These patterns provide a way to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation, and they help to control the complexity of object creation, making the design more flexible and maintainable.
