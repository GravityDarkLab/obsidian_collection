It is an [[Anti-pattern]].

`Also known as: dead code`.

- The Lava Flow antipattern is a software development pattern where a codebase becomes so old and outdated that it becomes difficult and time-consuming to make changes or add new features. This is often the result of neglecting to update the codebase over time, leading to a large amount of legacy code that is difficult to understand and maintain.

- An example of this in Java would be a large codebase with outdated libraries, frameworks, and programming practices, that is difficult to navigate, understand and modify.

- To refactor this pattern, a developer should start by identifying the most critical parts of the codebase that need to be updated or refactored. They should then create a plan to gradually update or refactor the codebase over time, in a way that minimizes disruption to the existing functionality.

- It's important to keep in mind that refactoring a large codebase is a big task, and it should be approached step by step and should be well-planned, this may include:
	-   Introduce automated testing to ensure that changes do not break existing functionality
	-   Update the libraries and frameworks to their latest versions
	-   Use modern programming practices and design patterns
	-   Break down the codebase into smaller, more manageable modules
	-   Remove unnecessary or duplicate code
	-   Document the codebase to make it easier for new developers to understand
