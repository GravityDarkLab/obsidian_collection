It is an [[Anti-pattern]].

- The functional decomposition antipattern is a software development pattern where a developer breaks down a problem into excessively small and highly specialized functions, often resulting in overly complex and hard-to-maintain code.

- An example of this in Java would be a developer who creates a large number of small functions to perform specific tasks, even when these tasks could be combined into a single, more general function.

> To refactor this pattern, a developer should take a step back and evaluate the functions they have created. They should look for opportunities to combine similar functions into a single, more general function. This will result in fewer, more cohesive functions that are easier to understand and maintain.
