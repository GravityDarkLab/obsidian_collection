An anti-pattern is a common solution to a problem that is ineffective and does not work well. It describes a bad solution that should be avoided. It is a common practice or approach that initially appears to be a good idea but ultimately proves to be problematic or ineffective.

Main Antipatterns:
	- **[[Spaghetti code]]**: A messy, unstructured and hard-to-maintain codebase.
	- **[[Blob (God class)]]**: A class or module that has grown to become too large and contains too many responsibilities.
	- **[[Lava flow]]**: A codebase that has become so difficult to change that no one wants to make modifications to it.
	- **[[Golden Hammer]]**: Overusing a specific tool, library or framework because it has become the go-to solution for all problems.
	- [[Functional decomposition]].
	- **[[Copy-paste programming]]**: Reusing code by copying and pasting it instead of abstracting it into a separate component.
	- **Shotgun surgery**: Making a small change to a system that requires making many unrelated changes to other parts of the system.
	- **Tight coupling**: Designing components that depend heavily on each other and cannot be reused or changed independently.
	- **Big ball of mud**: A system with no recognizable structure or organization, where everything is interconnected and it's hard to understand or make changes to.
	- **Not invented here**: Refusing to use existing solutions or libraries because they were not developed in-house.
	- **Premature optimization**: Optimizing a system before it's necessary, which can lead to over-engineered solutions and added complexity.
	- **Magic numbers**: Using hard-coded values in the code without providing meaningful names or explanations.
	- **Single point of failure**: Designing a system with a single component that, if it fails, will cause the entire system to fail.
	- **Hardcoded dependencies**: Hard coding the specific dependencies of a component, making it difficult to change or test.
	- **[[Vendor lock-in]]**.
	- [[Analysis paralysis]]
