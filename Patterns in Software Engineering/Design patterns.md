 A Design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Patterns are not specific to any programming language, rather they are language-independent concepts.
- Design patterns are categorized into three groups:
	- [[Structural Pattern]]: focus on the best way to compose classes or objects together to form larger structures.
	- [[Behavioral patterns]]: focus on communication between objects and how to distribute responsibility.
	- [[Creational patterns]]: focus on the best way to create objects, classes or systems.
