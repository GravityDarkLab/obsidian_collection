It is an [[Anti-pattern]].

Spaghetti code is a software development pattern where the code is written in a way that is difficult to understand, maintain, and debug. The code may have a lot of redundant, duplicated, or confusing sections, and it may also have poor or non-existent structure, making it difficult to follow the flow of execution.

## Symptoms and consequences:
- Methods are process oriented, objects are named as processes.
- Execution flow is dictated by the class implementation of the objects, not by the class users.
- Inheritance is not used to provide for extension of the system; polymorphism is not used.
- The source code is difficult to reuse: point of diminishing returns: the software maintenance effort is greater than a complete reengineering effort.
- **Typical causes**:
	- No design prior to implementation â€¢ Inexperience with object oriented design technologies

## Example:
An example of this in Java would be a method or class with a lot of nested if-else statements, convoluted logic, and hardcoded values that are difficult to understand and maintain.
```java
// Spaghetti code example
public class ComplexAndHardToUnderstand {
    public void someMethod() {
        if (condition1) {
            if (condition2) {
                // Some logic
            } else {
                // Some other logic
            }
        } else {
            if (condition3) {
                // Some other logic
            } else {
                // Some other logic
            }
        }
    }
}
```

> To refactor this pattern, a developer should aim to make the code more readable, maintainable, and scalable by following best practices such as:
	-   Breaking down complex logic into smaller, more manageable functions
	-   Avoiding hardcoded values and using variables or constants instead
	-   Using descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes
	-   Avoiding complex and nested if-else statements and using more appropriate control structures such as switch-case or strategy pattern
	-   Documenting the code to make it easier for other developers to understand.

```java
// Refactored example
public class CleanAndReadable {
    public void processData(int data) {
        int result = calculateResult(data);
        if (result == RESULT_A) {
            handleResultA();
        } else if (result == RESULT_B) {
            handleResultB();
        } else {
            handleDefaultResult();
        }
    }

    private int calculateResult(int data) {
        // Some logic
        return result;
    }

    private void handleResultA() {
        // Some logic
    }

    private void handleResultB() {
        // Some logic
    }

    private void handleDefaultResult() {
        // Some logic
    }
}
```
