```
Certificate Authority Authentication (CAA) is a security measure used to specify which Certificate Authorities (CAs) are allowed to issue certificates for a domain. It's designed to reduce the risk of unauthorized certificate issuance, which can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, phishing, and other security breaches.
```

### Board concept

- Our Browsers trust dozens to hundreds of root CAs.
- An attacker must only convince one of these to mis-issue for your domain to get valid certificate.
- You as domain owner might want to ever obtain certs from only one CA.

### Realization

- Use newly defined **DNS** record type '==CAA==.
- Domain owner can specify a list of CAâ€™s permitted to issue certificates for the domain.
- CAA records are valid for all subdomains unless the domain specifies its own records.
