### Public logs for X.509

- Based on different logs around the globe, run by different parties.
- Aim: make transparent who issued which certificates to whom, and when
- Only adds certificate with a valid signature chain (and also stores this chain).
- Any one can verify logsâ€™ content and their correct operation.

### Public Log Monitoring

- **Primary function:** continuously verify the ==append-only== property (consistency checks)
	- Prove the append-only property.
	- Prove that no certificate was removed from the log, or some certificate injected in the wrong position.
	- The logs, cannot tamper the logged history.
- Act on behalf of less powerful entities (e.g. browsers)
- **Secondarily**: keep a copy of logs.
- This enables them to search for violating certificates issuances.
- Research: 
	- Evaluate issued certificates
	- Analyse information leaks in logs, how long does it take until a new domain in CT gets scanned?
- **Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT)**:
	- Can be used to validate that a certificate has been logged.
	- Three different methods:
		- [[X.509]]v3 certificate extension 
		- TLS extension
		- OCSP Stapling
