### Downgrade attacks:
- Attacker interfere with TLS 1.2 handshakes.
- Victim will downgrade to TLS 1.1

### How to protect?

- Client appends a Signalling Cipher Suite Value (SCSV) to the TLS 1.1 handshake: **TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV{0x56, 0x00}**
- This tells the server that the client support only higher version of the TLS.
- If the server also support higher version of TLS, it must cancel the connection with an **inappropriate_fallback_alert**.
