TLS, or Transport Layer Security, is a protocol designed to provide secure communication over a computer network. **Think of it like a protective tunnel for data traveling between systems, like your browser and a website**.

1. **Purpose**: TLS is used to encrypt data sent over the internet, ensuring that the information remains private and unaltered. It's like having a confidential conversation in a noisy room, but with the assurance that no one else can eavesdrop or change the message.

2. **How it Works**:
    - **Handshake**: When two systems connect (say, your browser and a website), they perform a "handshake." This is where they agree on the encryption methods and exchange keys for encryption.
    - **Encryption Keys**: These are like secret codes that scramble and unscramble data. Only the two systems in the handshake know these keys, keeping the data secure from others.
    - **Data Transfer**: Once the secure connection is established, data can flow between the systems, encrypted and safe from prying eyes.

### Handshake Overview

1. **Client Hello**: Imagine your browser (the client) sends a note to a website (the server) saying, "Hi, I want to talk securely. Here's what I can do," listing supported TLS versions, cryptographic algorithms, etc.
2. **Server Hello**: The website responds, "Okay, let's talk securely. Here's what I'll use from your list." It picks the TLS version and encryption methods they'll both use.
3. **Server's Credentials**: The server then provides its ID in the form of a digital certificate (like a verified badge). This certificate is issued by a trusted authority and proves the server is who it says it is.
4. **Key Exchange**: This is where things get interesting. The server might send a set of keys or parameters that the client will use to create a new, shared secret key. This key is what they'll use to encrypt their conversation.
5. **Client's Confirmation**: The client examines the server's certificate, ensuring it's valid and trustworthy. It then uses the provided information to create the shared secret key.
6. **Client Ready**: The client sends a message back saying, "I'm ready to start encrypted communication." This message is itself encrypted using the newly established secret key.
7. **Server Ready**: Finally, the server sends a similar message, also encrypted, saying, "I'm also ready."
