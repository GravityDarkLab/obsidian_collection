DNSSEC: prevent MitM and spoofing attacks. DNSSEC adds authenticity and integrity orotection to DNS replies.
```

- **DNSSEC** provides integrity protection and data origin authentication (**DNS**)
- Realized though public key cryptography signatures of DNS records.
- Signatures and other Meta-Information also stored as DNS records.
- Chain of trust established from root zone to child zones

Domain Name System Security Extensions, or DNSSEC, is essentially a set of protocols added to the standard DNS (Domain Name System) to make it more secure. The DNS is like the internet's phonebook, translating human-friendly domain names (like www.example.com ) into IP addresses that computers use to communicate. However, the traditional DNS didn't have built-in security measures, making it vulnerable to various attacks, such as cache poisoning or spoofing, where an attacker redirects traffic from a legitimate site to a malicious one.

**DNSSEC** aims to address these vulnerabilities by adding a layer of verification to the DNS lookup process. It uses digital signatures and public key cryptography to ensure that the DNS data you receive is authentic and hasn't been tampered with. Here's a simplified breakdown of how it works:

1. **[[Digital Signing]]**: DNSSEC allows DNS zone data (like the records that link domain names to IP addresses) to be digitally signed by the owner of the data. **==This means that every DNS response can be verified for authenticity==**.
2. Store signatures alongside DNS records.
3. Set of verified public keys for the DNS root zone (TTP).
4. **[[Chain of Trust]]**: **==Starting at the DNS root zone, which is signed with a known public key, there's a chain of trust down to the desired DNS record==**. Each level of the domain has its data signed and its keys certified by the level above, creating a trusted path.
5. **Validation**: On the user's end, DNS resolvers that support DNSSEC can validate these signatures using the chain of trust. If the data checks out, it's considered authentic. If it can't be validated, it's discarded, protecting users from potential DNS spoofing attacks.

- **RRSIG, DNSKEY, DS**: are used for RR verification
- **[[Next Secure Record (NSEC)]], NSEC 3, NSEC 3 PARAM** records provide authenticated denial of existence.

> Records in a zone are grouped to Ressource Record Sets (RRsets).
> No Single records, but only RRsets are signed.
> ==A DNS resolver must request and validate all records in RRset==.


```
DNS ressouce records (RRs) are grouped into RRsets based upon their type.
The resulting RRset is digitally signed using publick key cryptogrphy. The signatures are stored into a new record type (RRSIG) along side the existing records for a zone.
```

### How many keys does every zone have ?

```
Every zone has 4 keys in 2 keypairs:
- ZSK: Privare only signs resource records.
- KSK: Private key only signs ZSK pubkeys and the public key is employed as a long term key.
