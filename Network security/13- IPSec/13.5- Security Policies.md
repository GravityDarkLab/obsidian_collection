### Traffic Selectors
A Traffic Selector (TS) is a set of properties used to characterize IP packets. 
-  **IP Source Address**
	- **Function**: Identifies the originating IP address of the packets.
- **IP Destination Address**
	- **Function**: Identifies the intended recipient IP address of the packets.
- **Name**
	- **Types of Names**: Includes DNS names, X.500 names (used in digital certificates), or other name types. (will be resolved to ip Addresses)
- **Protocol**
	- **Protocol Identifier**: This refers to the transport protocol used by the IP packet, such as TCP or UDP.
	- **Limitation with ESP**: When the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) protocol is used for securing packets, the transport layer protocol information might not be accessible to the intermediate network devices since ESP encrypts the entire IP payload.
