[[13- IPSec]]

```
IPSec (Internet Protocol Security) works by securing Internet Protocol (IP) communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet of a session.
```

### 1. Establishing Security Associations (SAs)
- **Negotiation**: Before secure communication can start, the devices at either end use the Internet Key Exchange (**==IKE==**) protocol to negotiate the security parameters and establish SAs. This involves agreeing on the encryption and authentication methods, generating and exchanging key material, and establishing the IPSec mode (transport or tunnel).
- **SA Database**: Each device maintains a Security Association Database (SAD) that stores all the parameters (like keys and algorithms) needed to process each IPSec connection.

### 2. Securing Data Flows
- **Applying Security Policies**: Devices use their Security Policy Database (SPD) to determine how to handle incoming and outgoing packets. The SPD maps IP traffic flows to specific SAs based on criteria like source and destination IP addresses, transport layer protocols, and ports.
- **IPSec Modes**: Depending on the mode negotiated during the SA establishment, IPSec applies its security mechanisms differently:
  - **Transport Mode**: IPSec encrypts and/or authenticates the payload (the actual data) of the IP packet while leaving the header unchanged, used mainly for end-to-end communication between two hosts.
  - **Tunnel Mode**: IPSec encapsulates the entire IP packet (header and payload) into a new IP packet with a new header, used for network-to-network or host-to-gateway communications.

### 3. Encrypting and Authenticating
- **Encryption**: For confidentiality, IPSec encrypts the data using the algorithm specified in the SA (like AES or DES). `In tunnel mode, the entire packet is encrypted, while in transport mode, only the payload is encrypted`.
- **Authentication**: IPSec provides data integrity and authenticity by appending an authentication header (AH) or by using the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) header and trailer to authenticate the packet or its contents.
