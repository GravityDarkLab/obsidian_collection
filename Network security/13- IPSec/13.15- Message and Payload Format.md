- An SA payload may contain multiple proposals. Each proposal contains a set of security protocols with the corresponding algorithms to be used.
- **Allowed proposal types**:
	- **AH**: Integrity check algorithms.
	- **ESP**: Encryption and integrity check algorithm.
	- **IKEv 2**: DH group, PRF algorithms, encryption and integrity check.

- Proposals are ordered from most preferred to least preferred. Each proposal is identified with a proposan number (PN) such that:
	- The first proposal has PN = 1
	- Is proposal substructure has the same PN as previous one or one greater.
	- If two successive proposal structures have the same PN, the proposal consists of both structure.
