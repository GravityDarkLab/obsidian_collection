[[13- IPSec]].

```
Authentication Header (AH) is a protocol within the Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) suite that provides authentication, integrity, and optional anti-replay services for IP packets.
```

It provides:

1. **Authentication**: AH confirms that the data originates from the sender it claims to be from. 

2. **Integrity**: AH ensures that the data has not been altered during transmission. By using cryptographic hash functions, it creates a digest (or hash) of the packet contents, which is then checked by the receiver. 

3. **Anti-replay Protection**: This is achieved through the use of sequence numbers that ensure packets are processed in the correct order and any duplicate or out-of-order packets are detected and can be rejected.

AH can be used in two modes:

- **Transport mode**: In this mode, AH provides protection for the ==payload of an IP packet, along with some portions of the IP header==. 
- **Tunnel mode**: In tunnel mode, AH protects the ==entire IP packet==

> Some of the IP Header fields must not be protected as they are subject to change and do not hold sensible informations. (Example the Flags, Type of Service, Header checksum, TTL...)
