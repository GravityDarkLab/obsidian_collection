[[13- IPSec]].

```
IKEv2 is responsible for mutual authentication between two parties (usually a VPN client and server) and for establishing and maintaining the security association (SA) needed to encrypt and decrypt the traffic
```

### General properties:
- Runs on UDP ports 500 or 4500.
- Mutual Authentication of Initiator and Responder.
- Negotiation of cryptographic suites.
- IKEv2Â´s latency is 2 round trips.


## Advanced Features:

### Protection against flooding attacks

- Flooding attacks, such as IKE flood, aim to overwhelm a server by rapidly sending a large number of connection requests, consuming server resources and potentially causing denial of service (DoS) to legitimate users.

- IKEv2 incorporates several mechanisms to mitigate the risk of flooding attacks:
	- **Cookies to Prevent DoS**
	- **Rate Limiting**
	- **IPsec Anti-Replay Window**
	- **Client Authentication**

### Rekeying

- It refers to the process of generating new encryption keys to replace old ones during an ongoing session.

- How Rekeying Works in IKEv2:
	1. **Automatic Key Lifetimes**.
	2. **Initiation of Rekeying**.
	3. **Generation of New Keys**.
	4. **Seamless Transition**.
	5. **Deleting Old Keys**.

### Traffic Selector Negotiation

- This feature allows both ends of the VPN tunnel to negotiate the specific traffic that will be allowed through the tunnel. Traffic selectors define the parameters for traffic that can be protected, including information like IP addresses and port numbers for both the source and destination.

- How Traffic Selector Negotiation Works:
	1. **Proposal of Traffic Selectors**
	2. **Negotiation and Agreement**
	3. **Establishment of Security Associations (SAs)**
	4. **Dynamic Adjustment**

## What will be established
An IKEv2 protocol run between Initiator and Responder begins with two exchanges (Request, Response):
- **IKE_SA_INIT**: IKE SA parameters, nonces DH values.
- **IKE_AUTH**: Initiator/ Responder Identities, Auth previous messages, prove knowledge of secrets, first **CHILD_SA** parameters.
