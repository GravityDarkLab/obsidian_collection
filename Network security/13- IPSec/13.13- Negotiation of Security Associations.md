## Authentication
- IKEv 2 supports authentication via public key signatures or long-term pre-shared secret.
- Authentication by signing a block of data.
- The resulting value (AUTH) is transmitted in the IKE_AUTH exchange.
- Authentication is conducted by verifying the validity of the received AUTH payload.

> In some cases, the initiator may uses a MAX to generate the AUTH payload while the Responder uses a digital signature to generate the AUTH payload.
