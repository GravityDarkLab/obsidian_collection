[[13- IPSec]].

Replay protection is a security feature of IPSec that prevents an attacker from capturing and re-sending packets in an attempt to disrupt a communication session or gain unauthorized access to a system. IPSec implements replay protection by using sequence numbers in the packets along with a sliding window technique. Each packet has a unique sequence number, and the receiver tracks these numbers to identify and discard duplicate packets.


> **AH** and **ESP**-protected packets carry a sequence number.
