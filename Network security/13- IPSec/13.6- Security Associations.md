[[13- IPSec]]

```
A Security Association is a simplex channel that describes the way how packets need to be processed.

-> Explicit packet transformations for simplex channel between to communication parties.
```

> A Security Association is a unidirectional relationship between a sender and a receiver that **defines** the ==security properties== of the communication session.
> 
> Each **SA** specifies the encryption and authentication algorithms, the keys to use, and the mode (**transport** or **tunnel**). 
 
`SA represent a simpley channel for exactly one type of transformation.`
`Bidirectional communication requires 2 SAs.`
`Security Associations are stored in the Security Association Database (SAD)`.

An SA entry in the SAD includes:
- Security Parameter Index (SPI).
- IP source/destination address.
- A security protocol identified (AH/ESP).
- Current sequence number counter (replay protection).
- Protocol algorithms, modes, IVs and keys for authentication and encryption.
- Security Association Lifetime.
- IPSec protocol mode (tunnel /transport).
