[[13- IPSec]].

### Transport mode

- Only usable between communication endpoints.
	- Host <--> Host
	- Host <--> Gateway
- Adds a security specific header (+ trailer if ESP is employed)
- Used when cryptographic endpoints are also the communication endpoints of the secure packets.
- Used when at least one cryptographic endpoint is not a communication endpoint.

## Tunnel Mode

- Usable with arbitrary peers.
- Encapsulates IP packets.
- Used when at least one cryptographic endpoint is not communication endpoint.
