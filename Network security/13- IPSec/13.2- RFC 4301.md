[[13- IPSec]].

### Key Components of RFC 4301

- **Security Associations (SAs)**: It describes how SAs are used to define the parameters for securing communication between entities, including encryption and authentication methods.
  
- **Security Policy Database (SPD)**: RFC 4301 details the use of SPDs for determining the security treatments for incoming and outgoing packets, based on attributes like source and destination addresses, and types of traffic.
  
- **IPSec Modes**: It covers the operational modes of IPSec - **transport** and **tunnel** mode, explaining how each mode affects the encapsulation and protection of packets.

- **IPSec Protocols**: The document specifies the core IPSec protocols, namely the **==Authentication Header (AH) ==** for providing connectionless integrity and data origin authentication, and the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) for providing confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of packets.
  
- **Key Management**: While RFC 4301 itself does not define key management protocols, it references the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol (specified in RFC 4306) for negotiating, establishing, and managing keys and SAs between communication partners.
  
- **Processing Rules and Algorithms**: It provides guidelines on how packets should be processed according to the security policies, including procedures for encrypting, decrypting, authenticating, and handling packets.
  
- **Architectural Requirements**: The RFC outlines requirements for implementing IPSec, including interoperability standards, algorithm support, and configuration guidelines to ensure that different implementations can work together seamlessly.


#### Available Protocols
- [[13.9- Authentication Header]].
	- Inserted between the IP header and the data to be protected.
- Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
	- A header and a trailer encapsulating the data to be protected.
