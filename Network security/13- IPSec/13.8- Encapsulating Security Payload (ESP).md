Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) is a component of the Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) suite, which provides confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of data packets in IP networks.

- ESP offers:
	1. **Confidentiality**: By encrypting the payload of IP packets, ESP ensures that the data cannot be read by unauthorized parties. 
	   `This encryption is typically done using algorithms like AES or DES`.
	2. **Integrity**:  `This is usually achieved with cryptographic hashes like SHA-1 or SHA-2`.
	4. **Authentication**: Although ESP itself can provide authentication for the data source, it is often used in combination with the [[13.9- Authentication Header]] (AH) protocol for stronger security measures.
	5. **Anti-replay Protection**: ESP includes mechanisms to protect against replay attacks, where an attacker intercepts and retransmits packets in an attempt to disrupt communication or gain unauthorized access.

- ESP can operate in two modes:
	- **==Transport mode==**: ESP ==encrypts only the payload ==of the packet, leaving the original IP header intact. This mode is typically used for end-to-end communication between two parties.
	- **==Tunnel mode==**: ESP encrypts the ==entire IP packet==, including the original header, and then encapsulates it within a new IP packet with a new header. This mode is often used in VPN scenarios where entire packets need to be protected as they traverse an untrusted network.
