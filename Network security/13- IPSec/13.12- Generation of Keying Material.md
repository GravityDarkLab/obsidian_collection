[[13.14- Advanced IKEv2 Features]]

- In the context of **IKE_SA**, 4 cryptographic algorithms are negotiated.
	- Encryption algorithm
	- Integrity protection algorithm
	- DH parameters p and g
	- Pseudo-Random function $prf$.

### Pseudo-Random function:
$$
prf(K,S):= \text{function with parameters (key) and (Seed)}
$$
$$
prf(K,S) = HMAC_k(S) = H(K \oplus | H(K\oplus ipad | S))
$$
>The negotiated $prf$ is used for all subsequent keying material for IKE_SA and CHILD_SAs

> The Amount of needed keying may be greater than the output size of $prf$.
