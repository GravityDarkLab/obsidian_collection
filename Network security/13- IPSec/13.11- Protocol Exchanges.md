[[13- IPSec]].

The  IKEv 2 ([[13.14- Advanced IKEv2 Features]]) communication consists of message pairs:
- Request and response.
- One pair (request, response) is called an exchange.
- An **IKEv 2** protocol run starts with 2 exchanges:
	- $IKE\_SA\_INIT$:
		- Negotiate sec parameters for SA ($IKE\_SA$).
		- Sends [[nonce]] and [[Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol]] values.
	- $IKE\_AUTH$:
		- Authenticate the previous message.
		- Creates first $CHILD\_SA$
> Both need to be completed in a strict order before any other exchanges.

- Then we have:
	- $CREATE\_CHILD\_SA$ (can be used for re-keying)
	- $INFORMATIONAL$: (keeps alive, Delete a SA, Reporting errors...).
