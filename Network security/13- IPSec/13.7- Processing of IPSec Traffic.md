[[13- IPSec]].

The processing of IPSec traffic involves several steps:

- **Determination of Security Policy**: The system determines whether an incoming or outgoing packet requires IPSec protection based on the security policies.
- **SA Establishment**: If IPSec protection is required and no suitable SA exists, the system will attempt to establish a new SA, usually through a negotiation protocol like IKE (Internet Key Exchange).
- **Packet Processing**: For outgoing packets, the data is processed according to the parameters of the SA, which could involve authentication and/or encryption. For incoming packets, the reverse process is applied: decryption and/or authentication verification, based on the SA.
- **Transmission or Delivery**: Once processed, outgoing packets are transmitted over the network, and incoming packets, after being verified and decrypted as necessary, are delivered to the higher-level application or service.
