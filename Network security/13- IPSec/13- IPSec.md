```
IPSec is a suite of protocols for securing network communication by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet of a communication session. It operates at the network layer, allowing it to secure IP communications regardless of the application being used. IPSec supports network-level peer authentication, data origin authentication, data integrity, data confidentiality (encryption), and replay protection.

- Remember [[IPv4 Packet Format]].

> If **IPSec** is correctly employed, it provides:
> 
> 1. Data origin authentication.
> 2. Connectionless Data Integrity.
> 3. Confidentiality.
> 4. Security Policies: [[13.5- Security Policies]] && [[3.2- Security Policy]].
