`IP Spoofing: sending packets using a source IP address that is not yours`.

- **Packet Filtering**: Inspecting incoming packets at network borders to ensure their source addresses are legitimate for the incoming interface.
  
- **IPSec**: Implementing Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) can authenticate that packets received have come from the expected source. [[13- IPSec]].
  
- **Anti-Spoofing Rules**: Configuring network devices with rules that reject packets from internal networks if they have external source addresses.

- **DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)**: Protects against DNS spoofing by ensuring the integrity and authenticity of DNS data. [[11.6- Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC)]],

- **Email Authentication Techniques**: Techniques like SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) help to verify the authenticity of email senders and prevent email spoofing.


> The Linux kernel offers some spoofing protection for free: 
> **==reverse path filtering==** `/proc/sys/net/ipv 4/conf/all/rp_filter`
> - If a packet arrives at interface i, the kernel checks
> 	- Is the source IP of the packet reachable through i ?
> 	- If not, drop the packet
