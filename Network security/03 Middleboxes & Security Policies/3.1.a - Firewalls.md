### Overview

- Control Access to the network.
- Installed where a protected subnetwork is connected to a less trusted network.
- Generally between internet and local network.

### What does a Firewall do?

- By default nothing! $\rightarrow$ Needs to be configured
- For every packet, the ruleset is processed sequentially **==from top to bottom==** until a matching rule is found
- A rule consists of **==Match condition==** and ==**Action**==
- Actions are:
	- Accept
	- Drop (no response - timeout)
	- Reject (graceful drop)
	- Log
### Strategies (not same as [[3.1.b- Statefulness]])

```
"Default permit" and "Default deny" are foundational concepts that determine how firewalls handle traffic not explicitly addressed by the rules set within the firewall. These concepts are different from the operational modes (stateful vs. stateless) of firewalls.
```

##### Default Deny Strategy (Restrictive Strategy)
- Everything not explicitly allowed (= whitelisted/allowlisted) is denied
- Increased security; you know what applications are allowed to communicate
- Users that use non-standard applications/protocols will complain
##### Default Permit Strategy (Permissive Strategy)
- Everything not explicitly blocked (= blacklisted/blocklisted) is permitted
- Less secure
- Less hassle with users

> Best practice:
> - Default deny.
> - Default deny for inbound traffic, default permit for outbound traffic

#### Stateful vs. Stateless Firewalls
##### Stateless
- Operate by inspecting incoming packets and applying a set of rules to them based on static values like source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
- Do not keep track of the state of network connections.
- Simpler and faster but less secure as they don't understand the context of the traffic.

##### Stateful
- Keep track of the state of active connections (hence "stateful") and make decisions based on the context of the traffic, not just the fixed set of rules.
- Monitor the full state of active connections (like TCP handshakes) and can recognize if a packet is part of an existing conversation.
- Provide a higher level of security but can be more resource-intensive.

> **Rule of thumb**:
> • Stateless firewalls are more complex to configure
> • Which makes configuration errors more likely
> • ==Whenever possible, go for the stateful firewall!==
> • Note: Hardware is cheap... (especially compared to outcomes of a maybe disastrous security incident...)



### Common Errors

- **Misconfigurations**.
- **Shadowing**: Describes the phenomenon where one rule in a firewall overshadows or overrides another, leading to unintended access control behavior.
