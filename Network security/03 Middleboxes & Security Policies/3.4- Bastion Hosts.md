`A bastion host is a host that is more exposed to the hosts of an external network than the other hosts of the network it protects`.

- **A bastion host may serve for different purposes**:
	- Packet filtering.
	- Providing proxy services.
	- A combination of both

- **Rules**:
	- Keep it simple
	- Prepare for the bastion host to be compromised
	- ==Connect in such a way that it cannot sniff internal traffic==
	- Extensive and tamper-resistant logging
	- Reliable hardware configuration and physically secure location
	- Disable ssh password login (only public key login)
	- Disable user accounts
	- Monitor the machine closely (reboots, usage / load patterns, etc.)
	- Regular backups
