- Attacks can be detected by being aware of
	- Unusual or suspicious actions
	- Unusual or suspicious alterations of stored information (config files)
- **What do we want to detect?**
	- Intrusion preambles (probes) - brut force, new app...
	- Intrusion accesses from the outside - remote access
	- Abusive behaviors from the inside - brute force, data being encrypted...

### Classification:

![[Pasted image 20240102162907.png]]
- **Detection Method**:
	- `My Aunt: Think of "My Aunt" as someone who either strictly follows rules (misuse detection) or notices when something unusual happens (anomaly detection).`.
	- **M**isuse Detection
	- **A**nomaly Detection
- **Data Source**:
	- `New Home: reminds you that protection can either guard the entire neighborhood (network-based) or just a single house (host-based).`.
	- **N**etwork-based
	- **H**ost-based
- **Detection Delay**:
	- `Rapid Action`
	- **R**eal-time
	- **A** posteriori (after the fact)
- **Reaction**:
	- `Peace or Action: represents the choice between just observing (passive) or taking steps to counteract (active).`
	- **P**assive
	- **A**ctive
- **Analysis**:
	- `Individually Coordinated: highlights whether the defense acts alone (individual) or works together with others (cooperative)`.
	- **I**ndividual
	- **C**ooperative
```
"My Aunt's New Home requires Rapid Action, Peace or Action, Individually Coordinated."
```


- **Misuse Detection**:
	- `Knowledge based scanning for predefined signatures. Fast detection of known attacks. False possitive error rate is typically low`.
	- Store signatures of attacks in a database
	- Monitor traffic for signatures
	- Frequently update signature database
- **Anomaly Detection**:
	- `Behaviour-driven comparison between a predefined normal system state and the current state. System is able to detect new attacks, but typically has a higher false positive error rate`.
	- Model a normal or expected state of a system
	- Compare the current state to the model
	- Raise alarm if the current state differs more than a certain threshold

### Network-based IDS vs Host-based IDS

- **Network-based IDS**:
	- Performs analysis on network packets.
	- Cannot analyse encrypted data
	- ==Detects==:
		- Unauthorized network access
		- Reconnaissance (e.g. network scans)
		- Abuse of bandwidth resources (e.g. DoS)
	- Assuming a NIDS is connected to the protected networkÂ´s switch:
		- It will detect a compromised workstation which performs port scans or sends payloads, containing predefined signatures.
- **Host-based IDS**:
	- Analyses data from individual systems.
	- Able to work in environments with encrypted data.
	- ==Detects==:
		- Privilege Abuse
		- Accidentally assigned privileges
		- Account compromise
		- Access and modification of critical data.
		- Information leakage
	- The HIDS could monitor the machines for attacks that compromise configuration integrity on the server itself. However running a HIDS adds performance drawbacks.
