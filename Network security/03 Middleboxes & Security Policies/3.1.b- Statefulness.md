- Packets may generate state ("memorized meta data") in the firewall.
- State helps keep track of connections, it uses the IP-5-tuple to identify "known" connections: $$(\text{Src IP, Dst IP, Protocol, Src Port, Dst Port})$$
- States ("conditions") of a connection
	- **NEW**: First packet of a connection (no state (meta data) in firewall yet)
	- **ESTABLISHED**: All following packets (state (meta data) exists in firewall)
- Optional State tracking (depending on your firewall)
	- TCP sequence and ack numbers
	- ICMP sequence numbers and request/response tracking
	$\rightarrow$ Idea: numbers must grow monotonously (till they wrap around)


> ==N.B==: UPD is stateless, no connections exist
> - Approximation of UDP connection tracking possible using a timer (new packet resets timer; state cleaned when timer runs out)
â€¢ Example: Attacker sends spoofed DNS replies in the hope that victim accepts one as
An answer to a previous DNS query.
