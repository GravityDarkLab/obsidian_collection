### How is a certificate issued in practice?

- **Domain Validation (DV)**: proves ownership of the domain
	- Publish a CA-specified [[nonce]] in a DNS TXT record.
		- This is a proof that you can control the whole domain.
	- Publish a CA-specified nonce on the web server.
		- This is a proof you can control the URL.
	- CA sends mail to mail address specified in domain’s whois info; respond to this mail
	&
	- CA sends mail to "protected" mail address ( admin@... ); respond to this mail
		- This is a proof that you are the admin.

> Note: **Let’s Encrypt** issues DV certificates.

- Extended Validation (EV):
	- Requires (strong) legal documentation of the claimed identity
- Organisational Validation (rare):
	- Between DV and EV; less documentation

> No companies name is attached to the certificate and you actually connect only to the server not it's identities.
