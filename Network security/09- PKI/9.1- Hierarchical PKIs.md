`Hierarchical Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs) are structured like a tree, with a clear, well-defined chain of trust`.

## How it works?

#### Root Certification Authority (Root CA)

At the top of the hierarchy sits the ==Root CA==. It's the most trusted authority in this structure. The Root CA generates a self-signed certificate — it uses its private key to create a digital signature on its own certificate. This certificate is widely distributed and embedded in various software and devices (like web browsers) as a trusted root certificate.

#### Intermediate Certification Authorities (RA)

Below the Root CA are one or more levels of Intermediate CAs. These are essentially trusted entities but one step down from the Root CA in terms of trust level. The Root CA issues certificates to these Intermediate CAs. Why have them? It's a security measure. By limiting the use of the Root CA's key (it's used only to issue certificates to Intermediate CAs), the risk of its compromise is reduced.

#### Issuance of Certificates to End Entities

The Intermediate CAs are responsible for issuing certificates to end entities. When an Intermediate CA issues a certificate, it verifies the identity of the requestor (like in the CSR process) and then signs their certificate using its own private key.

#### Chain of Trust

The idea here is to establish a chain of trust from the Root CA down to the end-entity certificate. When a device (like your computer or smartphone) encounters a new certificate, it checks this chain. It will verify the signature on the certificate against the Intermediate CA's certificate, then verify the Intermediate CA's certificate against the Root CA's certificate. If this chain leads back to a Root CA that's in the device's trust store (a list of pre-installed root certificates), the certificate is trusted.

#### Revocation and Management:

Hierarchical PKIs also need to manage the lifecycle of certificates, including revocation. If a certificate is compromised or no longer valid, it needs to be revoked. This is typically done through Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP).

#### Advantages

The hierarchical model's main advantage is its clear and straightforward structure. It simplifies trust management and is the foundation of most of the internet's secure communication protocols (like SSL/TLS for HTTPS).

#### Disadvantages

This model heavily relies on the security of the Root CAs. If a Root CA is compromised, the entire trust model can be undermined. Moreover, the centralization of trust makes it potentially vulnerable to legal or political pressures.
