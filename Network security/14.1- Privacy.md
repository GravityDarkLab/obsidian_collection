- **Transparency**:
	- The data processing practices and policies of an organization should be open and transparent to users and regulators.
	- **Application**: Implementing privacy notices, disclosure policies, and practices that are easily accessible and understandable.
- **Unlinkability**:
	- Limiting the collection, storage, and processing of personal data to what is strictly necessary for the intended purpose.
	- **Application**: Practices include only collecting data that is directly relevant and necessary for a specified purpose and deleting data that is no longer needed.
- **Purpose Limitation**:
	- Restricting the processing of personal data to the original purposes for which it was collected, unless the data subject has given explicit consent for a new purpose or if a legal exception applies.
	- **Application**: Implementing mechanisms to track the purposes for which data was collected and ensuring that any further processing aligns with those purposes or involves obtaining new consent.

> **Confidentiality vs. Availability**: Confidentiality constrains access to information, while availability demands that information is accessible.
> 
> **Integrity vs. Intervenability**: Integrity constrains the ability to change information, while intervenability requires that stakeholders are able to change information when necessary.
> 
> **Unlinkability vs. Transparency**: Unlinkability demands that information cannot be combined, transparency requires that insight is possible how personal information of individuals are processed.
