- **Idea**: Protocol principles prove their identity before their message is further processed. Pre-Authentication as generic concept supports all kinds of authentication concepts.

### How does it works?

1. **Initial Request with Pre-Authentication**: When the client initiates a request for authentication, it includes a pre-authentication data in the request. This pre-authentication data typically consists of a **timestamp** ==encrypted with the user's password-derived key==.

2. **KDC Verification**: Upon receiving the request, the KDC (specifically, the Authentication Server component) attempts to decrypt the pre-authentication data with the password-derived key it has stored for that user. If the decryption is successful and the timestamp is within an acceptable range, the KDC concludes that the request is indeed from the claimed user.

3. **TGT Issuance**: Once pre-authentication is verified, the KDC proceeds with the normal Kerberos process. It issues a TGT encrypted with the client's secret key, which the client can then use to request service tickets from the Ticket Granting Server (TGS).

4. **Increased Security**: By requiring this initial proof of identity, Kerberos Pre-Authentication makes it significantly harder for attackers to perform replay attacks or to guess passwords through offline dictionary attacks. The attacker would need to know the user's password to generate valid pre-authentication data.
