### Brute Force Attack
This is the most straightforward approach where an attacker tries every possible key until the correct one is found. The feasibility of this attack largely depends on the key length; longer keys mean more possible combinations and higher security.

## Known Plaintext Attack
In this scenario, the attacker has access to both the plaintext (unencrypted data) and its corresponding ciphertext (encrypted data). ==They analyze this pair to find the key==.
> Requires that there is some services called `oracle` with a weakness that you can exploit
### CipherText-Only Attack 
This is when the attacker only has access to a bunch of ciphertexts. The goal is to deduce the plaintext or the key. This attack often relies on analyzing patterns in the ciphertext and is more challenging than a known plaintext attack.

### Chosen Plaintext Attack
Here, the attacker can choose arbitrary plaintexts to be encrypted and gets to see the corresponding ciphertexts. The idea is to select plaintexts in a way that the resulting ciphertexts reveal information about the key.
