- Confidentiality: This is all about keeping things secret.
- Data Integrity: Think of this as ensuring the accuracy of your information.
- Authenticity: This confirms the identity of the entities involved.
- Control Access: This is like having bouncers at a club door.
- Accountability: Accountability is about keeping a record of actions.
- Availability: This ensures that services and data are always up and running when needed.

#### 1. Confidentiality - Vertraulichkeit
- Ensuring that sensitive information is accessible only to those authorized to view it.
	→ Attacker cannot read/understand information
- Example: 
	- Encrypt information with a symmetric cipher
#### 2. Data Integrity - Datenintegrität
- Changes to data must be noticeable
- Proves that data did not change.
	→ Attacker cannot modify data without being detected
- Example:
	- Hash value (“fingerprint”) of a file stored on a public server.
	- The fingerprint is stored at some secure location
- **Integrity is often achieved by hashing data which creates a checksum)**.
- See [[5- Cryptographic Hash Functions and Message Authentication Codes]].
#### 3. Authenticity (of data/of a communication partner) - Echtheit
- Proves that data was created/modified by user x.
- Example: 
	- Digital signature over the hash of a file authenticates the hash (and the file)
	- A challenge/response protocol authenticates our communication partner.
- **Authenticity is often achieved using hashing and signing**. See [[7-Asymmetric Cryprography]].
#### 4. Controlled Access- Authorization - Zugriffskontrolle
- Only authorized entities can access certain services or information
#### 5. Accountability - Zurechenbarkeit
- Identify the entity responsible for a (communication) event/change at a file/...
- Example: 
	- Employ a logging system
#### 6. Availability - Verfügbarkeit
- Services/data/... Must be available and function correctly
- Example: 
	- Important services/data shall be replicated/stored redundandly

```
- Authenticity -> Integrity
	- Achieving authenticity inherently contributes to integrity because when we verify the authenticity of a source or data, we are also ensuring that the data has not been altered by unauthorized entities.

- Authentificate then Authorize

- Authentification + Accountability = non-repudation
```

> However, it's crucial to distinguish that while authenticity helps in achieving integrity by ensuring data comes from a verified source, integrity measures are still needed to detect any unauthorized alterations to the data after it was sent by the authentic source.
