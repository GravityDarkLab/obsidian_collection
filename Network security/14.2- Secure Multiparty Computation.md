```
Secure Multi-party Computation (SMC or MPC) is a cryptographic method that allows multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private.
```
```
The essence of SMC is to enable parties to collaborate on computational tasks without revealing their private data to each other, except for the final result.
```

### Core Principles

- **Privacy**: Each participant's input is kept secret from all other participants. They learn nothing except for the final outcome.
- **Correctness**: The computation's result is correct if all parties follow the protocol, ==even if some of them try to cheat==.
- **Independence of inputs**: The process does not require parties to disclose their inputs to a trusted third party or each other.

### How It Works

1. **Setup**: Parties agree on a specific function to compute. This function could be anything from a simple arithmetic operation to complex data analytics.
2. **Input Preparation**: Each party encrypts or otherwise secures their input so that it can be used in the computation without revealing it.
3. **Computation**: Through a series of cryptographic protocols, the parties jointly compute the function on their inputs. This often involves complex cryptographic techniques such as garbled circuits, homomorphic encryption, or secret sharing.
4. **Result Sharing**: The outcome of the computation is revealed to all parties (or a subset thereof), ensuring that no additional information about the individual inputs is disclosed.

### Key Techniques

- **Garbled Circuits**: Used for ==boolean circuit evaluation==, where a circuit representing the function is "**garbled**" so that it can be computed without revealing inputs.
		- `The idea is to "garble" the circuit, or encrypt it, in such a way that it can still be computed without revealing any of the inputs`.
		- See [[Securely Evaluating an AND gate]] for example.
		- Modifications exist to secure Yaoâ€™s Garbled Circuit Protocol against malicious adversaries:
			- **==1-out-of-2 OT==** protocols that are secure against malicious adversaries
			- Ensuring that the circuit constructing party correctly constructs the garbled circuit
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Allows computations to be ==carried out on ciphertexts==, producing an encrypted result that, when decrypted, matches the result of operations performed on the plaintext.
- **Secret Sharing**: Each participant's input is divided into shares that are distributed among all participants. The computation occurs on the shares, and the result can only be reconstructed by combining enough correct shares.

### Challenges and Considerations
- **Performance**: SMC protocols can be **computationally intensive** and **slower** than non-secure computations, especially for complex functions or large datasets.
- **Security vs. Efficiency**: There is often a trade-off between the level of security (e.g., against malicious adversaries) and the efficiency of the computation.
- **Communication Overhead**: SMC protocols typically require significant communication between participants, which can be a bottleneck.


> The security of SMC protocols is typically analyzed under different [[14.2.1- Adversary models]], which define the capabilities and objectives of potential attackers. Understanding these models is crucial for assessing the security properties of SMC protocols. Here are the four commonly considered adversary models in SMC:
