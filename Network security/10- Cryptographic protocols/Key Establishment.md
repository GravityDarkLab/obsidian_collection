[[10- Cryptographic Protocols]]

Key establishment is a fundamental concept in network security, ensuring that a secret key is securely shared between parties wanting to communicate privately.

It's divided into two main types: **Key Transport** and **Key Agreement**.

- **Key Transport**: In this scenario, a key is generated by one entity and securely transported to the other participant(s). For example, a server might generate a session key and encrypt it using the public key of a client; only the client can decrypt it with their private key. This method is straightforward but centralizes the creation of the key to one entity.

- **Key Agreement**: Differently, key agreement involves all participating entities in the generation of the shared key, ensuring that each has a role in its creation. The most common example is the [[Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol]], where each party contributes to the generation of the key through a mathematical operation that combines their private information with publicly shared data. This way, the key is agreed upon rather than transported, making no single entity responsible for its creation.

When it comes to practical implementation, **Entity Authentication** and **Key Establishment** often go hand-in-hand to secure the communication from the outset. Authentication ensures that the entities are who they claim to be before any sensitive information, like a key, is exchanged. One method to achieve this is by using an **HMAC (Hash-Based Message Authentication Code)** alongside the key exchange parameters.
