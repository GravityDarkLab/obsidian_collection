The NT LAN Manager (NTLM) Relay Attack is a type of cyberattack specifically targeting the **==NTLM authentication protocol used in Windows networks==**.

1. **Interception**: The attacker places themselves in the network's communication path. This can be done using techniques like **ARP poisoning** or exploiting a **man-in-the-middle position**. The attacker then waits for a client to authenticate to a service.

2. **Relay of Authentication Request**: When a client attempts to authenticate to a service (like a file server or a web server), the attacker intercepts the NTLM authentication request. This request includes the username and an NTLM response, which is a hash computed from the user's password and a server challenge.

3. **Forwarding the Request**: Instead of trying to crack this hash, the attacker immediately forwards this authentication request to another service within the network. **This is the crux of the relay attack: the attacker uses the legitimate credentials of the victim, in real-time, to authenticate to a different service**.

4. **Unauthorized Access**: The receiving service, seeing a valid NTLM authentication request, grants access.
