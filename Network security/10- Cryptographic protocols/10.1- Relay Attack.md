- A Relay Attack is a type of network security breach where an attacker intercepts and relays messages between two parties who are communicating with each other, **without modifying the content of the messages**.

> The key aspect of this attack is that the attacker makes it appear as though the two legitimate parties are communicating directly with each other, when in fact the attacker is relaying the messages between them. 

## How it works?

1. **Interception**: The attacker positions themselves in such a way (either physically or digitally) that they can intercept the communication signal.

2. **Relaying**: The attacker then relays the signal from the device to the receiver and vice versa. This is done in real-time, so neither the sender nor the receiver is aware of the attackerâ€™s presence.

3. **Execution**: By doing this, the attacker can, for example, unlock a car or make a payment without having direct access to the key fob or the card. The legitimate devices think they are communicating with each other directly because the attacker does not alter the content of the communication.

## Defenses

- Add informations to detect if messages are being replayed.

### How to proof freshness of protocol runs?

Proving the freshness of protocol runs is crucial in cryptographic communications to ensure that the messages are recent and not replayed from a previous session.

Two common methods used to achieve this are nonces and timestamps.


1. **Nonces (Number used ONCE)**:
   - **Concept**: A [[nonce]] is a random or pseudo-random number that is generated for a specific session or communication. It is used only once and helps to ensure that old communications cannot be reused in replay attacks.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Each party in a communication generates a unique nonce and shares it with the other party.
     - When a response is sent back, it includes the nonce to verify that it is responding to the correct request.
     - Each party needs to maintain a record of nonces that have been used. This ensures that any repeated nonce can be identified and rejected, indicating a potential replay attack.
   - **Limitations**: ==The need to store and check against a list of used nonces can become resource-intensive over time, especially in systems with high volumes of transactions==.

2. **Time Stamps**:
   - **Concept**: Time stamps are used to ensure the timeliness of a message. Each message is marked with the time at which it was sent, and the receiving party checks the time to ensure it's within an acceptable window.
   - **Implementation**:
     - The system clocks of the communicating parties **must be synchronized.** Protocols like NTP (Network Time Protocol) are often used for clock synchronization.
     - A time window is defined within which a message is considered valid. If a message is received outside of this window, it is rejected.
     - Similar to nonces, recent timestamps might be memorized to prevent the replay of recent messages.
   - **Limitations**: The effectiveness depends on the precision of time synchronization. Also, if an attacker can intercept and relay a message quickly, the timestamp might still appear valid.
