Forward Secrecy, also known as Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), is a property of secure communication protocols where the keys used to encrypt a session are not derived from a set of long-term keys. This means that even if the long-term keys are compromised in the future, the session keys used for past communications remain secure and cannot be retroactively decrypted.

1. **Key Generation**:
   - In systems with Forward Secrecy, new and unique encryption keys are generated for each session.
   - These keys are typically created using a key agreement protocol like [[Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol]] or ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) ([[ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) - Outlook]].

2. **Session Independence**:
   - The crucial aspect of Forward Secrecy is that the session keys are independent of each other and of the server’s private key.
   - This means that even if a server’s private key is compromised, it cannot be used to decrypt past sessions.

3. **Benefits**:
   - Enhanced Security: Forward Secrecy protects past communications from future key compromises.
   - Privacy Assurance: Users can be confident that their encrypted communications (like emails, messages, or calls) cannot be decrypted even if key theft occurs in the future.

4. **Implementation**:
   - Popular protocols like TLS (Transport Layer Security) often implement Forward Secrecy using **ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE)** or **ephemeral ECDH (ECDHE)**.
   - When you visit a website using HTTPS, for example, your browser and the server typically use Forward Secrecy to establish a secure, encrypted connection.

5. **Challenges**:
   - Performance: Generating new keys for each session can be computationally more intensive.
   - Key Management: Systems must handle a larger number of keys, as each session has its own unique key.

6. **Used parameters**

- $DH_B$ provided by Bob. $\rightarrow DH:g^b\mod p$
