1. **Can an attacker complete a three-way handshake?**
    - Yes, an attacker can complete a three-way handshake. This is often done in various forms of attacks.
    - The attacker **initiates** a connection to a server or another user's system just like any other user would.

2. **Can an attacker with a spoofed source address complete a TCP three-way handshake?**
    - Yes, but with limitations. When an attacker spoofs their source address (essentially faking their IP address), they can still initiate a three-way handshake. The server will respond to the spoofed address. However, since the acknowledgment from the server (SYN-ACK packet) is sent to the spoofed address, the attacker won't directly receive this response if they don't control the spoofed address.

3. **Can an attacker with a spoofed source address, limited by position such that they do not receive answers to spoofed packets, successfully complete a TCP three-way handshake?**
    - Typically, no. Completing a TCP three-way handshake requires the initiator to respond to the SYN-ACK packet sent by the receiver. If the attacker is spoofing an IP address and is not in a position to intercept or receive the SYN-ACK packet sent to the spoofed address, they cannot send the final ACK packet to complete the handshake. However, there are complex attack scenarios (like blind attacks) where an attacker might guess the correct sequence number to send the final ACK, but this is challenging and less reliable.
