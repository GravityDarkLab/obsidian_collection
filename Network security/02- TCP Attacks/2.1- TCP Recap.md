### Key points about TCP:
1. **Connection-Oriented**: Before any data transfer, TCP establishes a connection using a process called the three-way handshake.
2. **Reliable Delivery**: TCP keeps track of packets sent, ensuring they all reach the destination. If something gets lost along the way, TCP re-sends it.
3. **Ordered Delivery**: It makes sure data is read in the order it was sent.
4. **Error Checking**: Through checksums, TCP checks for any errors in the data. If there's an error, it can request a re-transmission.
5. **Flow Control**: This prevents a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver.
6. **Congestion Control**: TCP senses network congestion (too much traffic) and reduces the amount of data it sends to ease the congestion.
