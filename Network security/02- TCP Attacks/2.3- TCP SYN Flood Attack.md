### What is it?

-  `The TCP SYN Flood Attack is a type of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.`

-  `A TCP SYN Flood Attack turns the normal TCP handshake process into a weapon, exploiting the server's need to hold open a connection until the handshake is complete.`

> In a TCP SYN Flood Attack, an attacker sends a flood of SYN packets (starting signals for a TCP connection) with spoofed IP ==addresses== to a target server. This causes the server to **allocate resources for each connection attempt**, waiting for a response that never comes. As these **==half-open connections accumulate==**, the server's resources get **overwhelmed**, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.
> Essentially, it's an attack that abuses the normal TCP connection process to overload the server.

### Avoid using TCP SYN Cookies

`TCP SYN cookies are a technique used to protect against SYN Flood attacks`.

- **SYN Cookies Concept**: Instead of allocating memory for each SYN request, the server uses a cryptographic hashing technique. When it receives a SYN request, the server doesn't create the usual "half-open" connection. Instead, it sends back a **SYN-ACK** response with a specially crafted sequence number.    
- **No State Held**: The key here is that the server doesn't store any state information about this connection. It "encodes" the information it needs into the sequence number of the SYN-ACK packet.
- **Client's ACK Response**: If the client is legitimate and sends back the correct ACK response, the server can verify this by re-computing the hash and checking the sequence number. If it matches, the server then proceeds to establish the connection.

> Bob generates the initial SEQ $\alpha$ such as $\alpha=h(K,Src_{syn})$ where:
> 	- $K$ : secret key
> 	- $Src_{syn}$ : source address of the SYN packet 
> 	- $h$ : is a one-way cryptographic function

### Advantages and disadvantages

**Advantages of SYN Cookies:**

- **Mitigates SYN Flood Attacks**.
- **Efficient Use of Resources**.
- **Requires no changes in the TCP protocol specification**.

**Disadvantages of SYN Cookies:**

- **Limited TCP Options**: SYN cookies can't store all the TCP options that might be included in the initial SYN packet, potentially leading to a reduced set of TCP features for connections initiated with SYN cookies. - `Ã€CK/SEQ number are only 32 Bit long
- **False Positives**: Under heavy load, legitimate SYN requests might be treated as part of an attack, leading to dropped connections or degraded performance for legitimate users.
- **Computational Overhead**: Generating and verifying SYN cookies requires additional processing, which might slightly increase the load on the server, especially under heavy traffic conditions.
