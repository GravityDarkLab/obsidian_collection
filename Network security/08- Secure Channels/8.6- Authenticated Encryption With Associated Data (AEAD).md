Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) is a form of encryption that **not only provides confidentiality and integrity** for the data being encrypted (the payload), but **also ensures the integrity (but not confidentiality) of additional data that is associated with the payload**. This associated data is often called "==header==" or "==metadata==".
The key characteristics of AEAD make it highly useful in various security-sensitive applications.

### Key Components

1. **Authenticated Encryption**: AEAD **combines** ==encryption== for ==confidentiality== and ==authentication== to ensure the integrity of the encrypted data. This means that any tampering with the encrypted data can be detected.

2. **Associated Data**: AEAD also authenticates, but does not encrypt, additional data that is associated with the encrypted payload. This might include information like headers, which need integrity but not confidentiality.

### How AEAD Works

1. **Encryption Process**:
   - The plaintext and associated data are input into the AEAD algorithm along with a secret key and a unique nonce (number used once).
   - The algorithm encrypts the plaintext and computes an authentication tag that covers both the encrypted data and the associated data.

2. **Decryption Process**:
   - During decryption, the ciphertext, associated data, and authentication tag are input along with the secret key.
   - The algorithm decrypts the ciphertext and verifies the authentication tag. If the tag doesn't match (indicating tampering or errors), the decryption process fails.

### Advantages

- **Security**: AEAD provides strong assurances of both the confidentiality of the data and the integrity of the entire package (encrypted data + associated data).
- **Efficiency**: It is more efficient than performing encryption and authentication separately as it combines both in a single step.
- **Error Detection**: Any tampering with either the encrypted data or the associated data is reliably detected.

### Applications

- **Network Security Protocols**: Protocols like TLS and SSH use AEAD to secure data packets, ensuring that the payload and headers are authentic.
- **Disk Encryption**: AEAD can secure data stored on disks, ensuring that the data and its metadata (like file location) are protected.
- **Secure File Transfer**: AEAD is used in protocols for secure file transfers, where both the data and file metadata need protection.

### Popular AEAD Algorithms

- **[[Galois - Counter Mode (GCM)]]**: Commonly used with AES (AES-GCM), it is widely used in network protocols like TLS.
- **[[Offset Codebook Mode (OCB)]]**.
- **ChaCha 20-Poly 1305**: Combines ChaCha 20 stream cipher and Poly 1305 MAC, known for its high performance, especially in software implementations.

### Conclusion

Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data is a sophisticated approach to encryption that ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data. Its ability to protect both payload and associated metadata makes it an essential tool in modern cryptographic practices, particularly in scenarios where both the data and its context are critical.
