[[8- Secure Channels]]
`The message is encrypted first. Separately, a MAC is computed on the plaintext and both the ciphertext and MAC tag are sent together.`


- **What is E&M?**
  In this method, the plaintext is encrypted first, and then a MAC is created on the plaintext. Both the ciphertext and the MAC are sent.

- **Advantages and Disadvantages**
  - *Pros*: The separation of encryption and MAC processes adds a layer of security.
  - *Cons*: Potential leakage of plaintext information through the MAC.
  - `Weakest of all 3`.

- **Real-world Application**
  - Less common, but useful in scenarios where integrity checking of the plaintext is crucial.
