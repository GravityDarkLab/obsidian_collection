### ESP Overview in IPsec

1. **Purpose**: ESP is designed to provide ==optional== **encryption** and ==optional== **authentication** for IP packets. It can be used in two modes:
	- Transport mode (encrypting/decrypting payload of IP packets).
	- Tunnel mode (encapsulating entire IP packets).

3. **Components**:
   - **Encryption**: ESP encrypts the payload of an IP packet to **ensure confidentiality**.
   - **Authentication**: Optionally, it provides integrity checking and source authentication (==through an additional MAC==).

### Working of ESP in the OpenBSD Kernel

1. **Initialization**:
   - When an IPsec policy is established in OpenBSD, the kernel initializes ESP for specified traffic.
   - This involves setting up [[13.6- Security Associations]] (SAs) which **define the parameters for encryption and authentication, like keys and algorithms**.

2. **Key Management**:
   - OpenBSD typically uses the IKE (**Internet Key Exchange**) protocol to manage keys required for ESP.
   - IKE negotiates and establishes shared keys securely and can periodically refresh these keys for ongoing security.

3. **Data Flow - Outgoing Packets**:
   - When a packet is to be sent, the kernel checks against its IPsec policy.
   - If ESP is required, the kernel encrypts the packet payload (in Transport mode) or the entire packet (in Tunnel mode) using the specified encryption algorithm and key from the SA.
   - If authentication is enabled, a MAC is computed and appended.
   - The packet, now containing the ESP header, encrypted data, and optionally the ESP trailer and authentication data, is sent over the network.

4. **Data Flow - Incoming Packets**:
   - Incoming packets destined for the system or passing through are inspected for ESP headers.
   - ==If an ESP header is found, the kernel uses the corresponding SA to decrypt the packet==.
   - ==If authentication is used, the kernel verifies the MAC. If the verification fails, the packet is dropped to prevent tampering==.
   - Once decrypted (and verified), the packet is processed as a regular IP packet.

5. **Security Considerations**:
   - OpenBSD's implementation of ESP in the kernel is designed to be secure and efficient, aligning with the system's overall emphasis on security.
   - Regular updates and audits help in maintaining the security integrity of the ESP implementation.

### Conclusion

In the OpenBSD kernel, ESP provides a robust mechanism for securing IP traffic, ensuring confidentiality, and optionally, integrity and authentication. Its integration into the kernel allows for seamless and efficient processing of secure IP packets, playing a critical role in OpenBSDâ€™s network security infrastructure. This implementation highlights OpenBSD's commitment to providing secure, reliable, and high-performing security solutions at the operating system level.
