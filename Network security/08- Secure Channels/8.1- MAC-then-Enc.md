[[8- Secure Channels]]

`The message is passed through a MAC algorithm, attaching an authenticity tag. Then, both the original message and the MAC tag are encrypted together`.

- **What is MtE?**
  MtE involves first creating a Message Authentication Code (MAC) for the plaintext and then encrypting both the plaintext and the MAC together.

- **Advantages and Disadvantages**
  - *Pros*: The MAC is also encrypted, providing confidentiality.
  - *Cons*: Vulnerable to certain attacks, such as padding oracle attacks. Decrypting an altered message can lead to security issues.
  - ==Encryption does not provide any message authenticity/integrity! - Does not protect the MAC==.

- **Real-world Application**
  - Historical use in SSL/TLS protocols. However, vulnerabilities led to its decline in favor of more secure methods.
