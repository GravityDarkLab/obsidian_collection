[[8- Secure Channels]]

`The message is encrypted, and then a MAC is applied to the ciphertext. The recipient first verifies the MAC before decrypting the message`.

- **What is EtM?**
  This method involves encrypting the plaintext first and then applying a MAC to the ciphertext.

- **Advantages and Disadvantages**
  - *Pros*: Considered the most secure. It allows for the verification of MAC before decryption, reducing exposure to attacks.
  - *Cons*: Slightly more resource-intensive due to additional computational steps.

- **Real-world Application**
  - Widely used in modern protocols like TLS 1.2 and above, recommended for its robust security features.
