- Suppose a family has two children, one of whom is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?
The answer to this question is not as straightforward as it might seem at first glance, and there are different ways to approach it. One common way is to use conditional probability, which involves calculating the probability of both children being boys given that we know one of them is a boy.

-   There are four possible gender combinations for the two children: BB (both boys), BG (one boy and one girl), GB (one girl and one boy), and GG (both girls).
-   We know that one of the children is a boy, which eliminates the GG option.
-   This leaves us with three equally likely possibilities: BB, BG, and GB.
-   Since we're interested in the probability of both children being boys, we can focus on the BB option. Out of the three remaining possibilities, only one corresponds to BB.
-   Therefore, the probability of both children being boys given that we know one of them is a boy is 1/3.
