Estimating probabilities is often necessary when exact calculations are challenging or infeasible. By applying various techniques, such as inequalities or approximations, we can obtain reasonable bounds or approximate values for probabilities. These estimation methods are particularly useful when dealing with complex or high-dimensional probability distributions.

Some common techniques used for estimating probabilities include:
- Inequalities:
	- Probability inequalities, such as the [[Markov]] inequality, [[Chebyshev]]´s inequality, or the Chernoff bound ([[Chernoff-Schranken]]), provide upper bounds on the probability of an event occurring. These inequalities can be used to obtain **==conservative==** estimates for probabilities.
